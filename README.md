# Vainglory Counter Data
This app uses the Vainglory API to find data of Vainglory hero matchups.

## Getting Started
View the data at [vgheroic.glitch.me](https://vgheroic.glitch.me/).

To see the the data in console so that you can parse it and retrieve information, go to [vgheroic.glitch.me/viewable](https://vgheroic.glitch.me/viewable). Then enter `data` to view the raw counter data.
